## Generalist win in the information agency

How to deal and crush it in the digital age.

The best skills to thrive today is to build enough knowledge, to learn how to learn in the digital envuronment. In the digital age to learn where everything is and how to get to it, you dont requre to be a master in all of the skills just be able to do them well enough to either close the cycle.
To my sursprise he refers to this as a polymath, in the digital age and though I have not heard it used outside of the knowledge of multiple languages, I certainly see its relevance inside the up and comming digital revolution.

#### Special quotes taken from Till Musshoff's soruced written:

**Creating the digital renessance man, polymath or generalist**

- "one that has a wide breath of knowledge or skills, bt who also has deep experteese in a number of depret areas, who is open to broad experiances, can be a divergent thinkier, and can solve probelms in creative ways as a result. polymath who have a wide range of experiances acorss fields yet still have depth in multiple areas are uniquely situated to integrate, to combine apply or synthesis information from different domains in order to help develope novel and usefull solutions. This is the superpower of a polymath because they have more tools in their toolkit they are able to apress problems more holistically and creatively."

- Jack of all traits, master of none.- common phrase that is not true now.

- "Entrepreneurs mind  
Atheltes body

- Getting into the flow state: If you are in something new and
It feels like play to you and work to others.


- what skill regardless of profession should improve on:
"Writting"
- writting is about thinking, a good writter is someone who can explain properly. "the best way to teach critical thinking is to write, you need to learn to think, and speack and write you are deadly. nothing can get in your way"-Jordan Peterson
