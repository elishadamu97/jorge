## Design Leadership
Andy Buddy, CEO  of Clearleft shares his perspectives inside a design leadership and his experiances in the industry.
Indicating what he thinks.

 #### "Hire people better than you and give them a place to excel"  


1. **Finding Talent**
  - Search for good talent and share with the world you are investing in your best  


2. **Hire slowly and retain the Talent**
  - mantain the interview promisses
  - through clear mission and values
  - Schedule Time to Experiment  


3. **Executing at Pace**
  - skill of a good design leader is to remove barriers
  - design op function = people that do shit so designers have to do
  - job as a leader is to model good behaviour,
  - Aristotel google project - What is the key to have more productivity
  - No. 1 Most important part of manage is provide psychological safety


4. **Managing up**
 - If you are design, you are part of business, dont blame other departments regarding what can and cannot be done
 - Good design leaders are "shit ubrellas". keep the shitstorm of a company outside of the department, and giving a space for design to grow.  


5. **Managing down**
 - Look over your team as if you they where your family, give them time and try to please them
  - Provide accionable feedback, With,   kim scott - radical panda
