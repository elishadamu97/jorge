Brand: Bunky  
Category: Brand Design  

This project was a developmet of a sports brand, inside a very traditional and price sensitive market.  

I was part of the brand development, the design of the upper and the brand communication including the packaging and virtual presence in Instagram.  
In the manufacturing I was also part of the regulation of the patternmaking for production and optimizing the production for laser-cutting the material upper with the internal team.
