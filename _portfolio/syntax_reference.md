## B.eva
Think for a second a family that would be vigilant in the market, father grew up with the black shoes , as did his younger brothers and sisters, he got arround and managed to provide something more, had less kids and payed more attention to them while they grew up. They had a complex to a pool in the beach and their kids started to become worried about the way they dressed. They could not buy a shoe that would break the bank like those chinses nickes not to mention tey dont last a year. He finds a nice white shoe that his older daugher aproves, and its just a bit more expensive that what he is used to spend in, and is lighter? But will it last the full school year maybe even more? Are the extra dollars worth it?

This shoe will last significantly more (x3) and is lighter, but its a tough sell to the traditional market. It was one of the biggest challenges to overcome in the development of the brand and product. Its brand intended to take over the eva introduction into the market with a strong brand and a stylish shoe.
